Form element in-line attributes:

- action: tells browser what URL to be used when submitting user inputted info from form
- method: specifies HTTP request method when submitting form to server (Can be GET, POST)
- novalidate: tells browser not to apply validation to form fields, leaving the task to Flask app running in server. This is optional

form template arguments:

- .hidden_tag(): generates hidden field including protection token generated by Flask-WTF from SECRET_KEY variable defined in config.py
- .username/password.label: label for input field which is seen above the form
- .username/password(size=32): input field, which can take in HTML attributes as arguments if required by the field.
  Here size=32 will be put into <input> element as an attribute when rendered. You can add CSS classes or IDs to form fields as well

form validation:

- {% for error in form.username/password.errors %}: We iterate through errors seen by Flask and placed into .errors dictionary field and display them in red.
